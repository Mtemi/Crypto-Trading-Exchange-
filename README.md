# Crypto-Trading-Exchange-
This is a Cryptocurrency Trading Exchange Like Binance, Huobi, Bybit, Bitmex, Bittrex, Phemex etc. That allows you to build your own Centralised Trading Exchange. I have forked it from Jammy928 accessible here:  https://github.com/jammy928/CoinExchange_CryptoExchange_Java . I realised Jammy doesn't respond on issues on his repo, and have taken up this mandate to setup the Exchange for anyone who needs it.  I can also dpo upgrades as per user requirements, Build iOS and Android Apps of the Exchange, Build Bots like: https://bitsgap.com on top of this for any trading Exchange.
